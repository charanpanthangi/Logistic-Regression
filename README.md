# Logistic Regression Model

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Logistic Regression model for binary classification tasks. It demonstrates the entire workflow, from loading the dataset to performing data analysis, training the model, evaluating it, and saving the trained model as a pickle (`.pkl`) file for future use. Additionally, the repository includes an example of how to load the saved model and make predictions using new input data.

### Key Features:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualize the distribution of individual features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore the relationship between independent variables and the binary target.
- **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model using the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Saving the Model**: Save the trained model as a `.pkl` file using `pickle`.
- **Loading and Prediction**: Load the saved model and make predictions with new input data.

### Files:
- **logistic_regression_model.pkl**: The trained Logistic Regression model saved for future use.
- **train_test_split.py**: The script that includes data splitting, model training, and testing.
- **model_prediction.py**: The script for loading the model and predicting on new data.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your dataset or modify the paths to fit your environment.
3. Run the scripts to train the model, evaluate its performance, and save it.
4. Use the `model_prediction.py` script to load the model and test with new inputs.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pickle
